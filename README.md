Description Section

This Python script automates the creation and management of user accounts on Unix-like systems. It reads input from stdin, expects lines in a specific format, and performs various operations to set up user accounts based on the provided information.






Operation Section  
- `username`: Desired username for the new account.
- `password`: Password for the new account.
- `firstname`: First name of the user.
- `lastname`: Last name of the user.
- `group1,group2,...`: Comma-separated list of groups the user should belong to.

2. **User Creation**: For each valid line of input, the script performs the following tasks:
- Creates a new user account using `adduser` command.
- Sets the password for the user using `passwd`.
- Assigns the user to specified groups.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure that the script has appropriate permissions to execute system commands such as `adduser` and `passwd`. Depending on system configuration, it may require sudo privileges.

## Usage Example
1. Create a text file containing user account information in the specified format.
```plaintext
# Example input.txt
john:password:John:Doe:users
alice:123456:Alice:Smith:admin,users
